## Car Sales Analysis

This repository contains my full analysis of the Bright Motors Car Sales dataset. The purpose of this project was to assist the newly appointed Head of Sales, who is looking for ways to grow sales, improve dealership performance, and better understand customer buying behaviour.

The project takes you through my full workflow — from planning, SQL processing, and data analysis, all the way to the final PowerPoint presentation.

##📌Project Summary

##🔍 Insights Summary
1. Transmission Performance

Automatic cars generate the most revenue, but also the highest losses.

Manual cars generate less revenue, but show more stable performance.

The Cayenne (manual) competes strongly with top-performing automatic models.

2. Revenue by Car Condition

Clear positive correlation:

Poor condition = low/negative revenue

Excellent condition = high/positive revenue

Selling cars in “good” and “excellent” condition yields the best returns.

3. Seasonal & Weekly Sales Patterns

Most sales happen in Summer, followed by Winter.

Almost no sales in Autumn.

Cars are only sold during weekdays.

Friday is the strongest sales day.

Sales increase gradually as the week progresses.

4. Time of Day Performance

Most sales are made in the morning, where revenue peaks.

5. Top Car Makes

The most sold car makes are:

Ford

Chrysler

Toyota

##📈 Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

Balance focus between automatic and manual car sales

Automatics bring revenue but also high loss margins.

Manual cars need stronger marketing and visibility.

Review stock strategy

Prioritise car makes that bring in the most sales.

Ensure popular models are always available.

Open dealerships on weekends

Sales rise as the week progresses; opening on weekends can boost revenue.

Focus on selling cars in good or excellent condition

These drive higher revenue and better customer satisfaction.

Strengthen customer relations

Introduce competitions, loyalty programmes, or incentives.
